      Škoda Auto a.s. (Czech pronunciation: [ˈʃkoda] ⓘ), often shortened to
      Škoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the
      successor to Laurin & Klement and headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech
      Republic. Škoda Works became state owned in 1948. After 1991, it was
      gradually privatized to the German multinational conglomerate Volkswagen
      Group, becoming a partial subsidiary in 1994 and a wholly owned subsidiary
      in 2000.[4][5] Škoda automobiles are sold in over 100 countries, and in
      2018, total global sales reached 1.25 million units, an increase of 4.4%
      from the previous year.[6] The operating profit was €1.6 billion in 2017,
      an increase of 34.6% over the previous year.[7][8] As of 2017, Škoda's
      profit margin was the second-highest of all Volkswagen AG brands after
      Porsche.
