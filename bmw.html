      The BMW M4 is a version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's
      motorsport division, BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the
      renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible variants of the 3 Series
      into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades
